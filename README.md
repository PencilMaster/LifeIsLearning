Profficient at general C, C++ and Java. Learning more through personal projects here.

1. Everything committed will be written and tested on Ubuntu Inside a VM
2. None of the code I write is generated. There are many reasons why, happy to elaborate if wanted.
3. I use AI to "google faster" -> find sources faster.
4. Nvim and gdb enthusiast, can work with IDEs as well.

# ========== IDEAS ==========

                                                     ____

Difficult that it changes size with written text within. Triggers on keystrokes inside, 
check if possible with row/col detection and tempfile that holds metadata "BoxObjects" that is updated during editing
